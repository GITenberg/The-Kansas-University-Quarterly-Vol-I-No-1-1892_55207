<p>The first American species of the singular group of extinct Mesozoic
reptiles variously know as Ornithosaurs, Pterosaurs or Pterodactyls was
described by Marsh from a fragmentary specimen obtained in 1870, by the
Yale College Expedition in Wallace County, Kansas. About a dozen other
specimens were obtained by a similar expedition the following year in
charge of Professor Marsh, or by Professor Cope, and were described by
these authors shortly afterward. By far the largest number of known
specimens, however, other than those in the Kansas University Museum,
were obtained during the years 1874, ’75, ’76 and ’77 by parties of
which Professor Mudge, Dr. H. A. Brous, E. W. Guild, George Cooper and
myself were the members, and it was from these specimens that most
of the published characters were derived. Many of these specimens
are necessarily fragmentary ones, still the material now in the Yale College
Museum is ample to elucidate everything of interest concerning these animals.</p>

<p>During the past few years, the Museum of Kansas University has been
enriched by a series of excellent specimens of these animals, obtained
from the same regions, specimens that permit the solution of most of
the doubtful characters and throw not a little light on the affinities
of the Kansas forms.</p>

<p>The species hitherto named are as follows:</p>

<h3>PTERANODON.</h3>

<p class="blockquot2"> <i>Pteranodon</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ. Sci. xi, p.

xxvii, p. 423, May, 1881; Williston, Amer. Naturalist, xxv, p. 1174,
Dec. 1891</p>

<h4>Pteranodon occidentalis.</h4>

<p class="blockquot2"><i>Pterodactylus Oweni</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ. Sci. i, p.
472, June 1871, Sep. p. 16 (nom. preoc).</p>

<p class="blockquot2"><i>Ornithocheirus harpyia</i> Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc.
1872, p. 471 (Cope).</p>

<p>This species was originally based upon the distal end of two
wing-metacarpals, and teeth. In the following year, a fuller
description was given of additional remains referred to the same
species and renamed <i>P. occidentalis</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<h4>Pteranodon ingens.</h4>

<p class="blockquot2"> <i>Pterodactylus ingens</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ Sci.
iii, p. 246, April 1872, Sep. p. 6.</p>

<p class="blockquot2"><i>Pteranodon ingens</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ. Sci. xi,
p. 508, June 1876.</p>

<p>This species is based upon various bones of the wing-finger of
several individuals, and three teeth.</p>

<h4>Pteranodon umbrosus.</h4>

<p class="blockquot2"> <i>Ornithocheirus umbrosus</i> Cope, Proc. Amer.
Phil. Soc. 1872, p. 471.</p>

<p class="blockquot2"><i>Pterodactylus umbrosus</i> Cope, Cret. Vert. p. 65,
pl. vii, ff. 1-4.</p>

<p>Marsh (Amer. Journ. Sci. xii, p. 480, Dec. 1876) says this name is a
synonym of <i>P. ingens</i>, published two days earlier. As this synonymy is
not certain, and as Cope’s species has been figured, I am not ready to
accept his views.</p>

<h4>Pteranodon velox.</h4>

<p class="blockquot2"><i>Pterodactylus velox</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ.
Sci. iii, p. 247, April 1872, Sep. p. 8.</p>

<p>Based upon the distal end of the right metacarpal of the wing-finger,
and the proximal extremity of the adjoining first phalanx, two
uncharacteristic parts of the skeleton, Marsh to the contrary
notwithstanding. It is doubtful whether the direct comparison of the
types will suffice to determine the species with certainty. “Both of
the bones are somewhat distorted by pressure.”</p>

<h4>Pteranodon longiceps.</h4>

<p class="blockquot2"> <i>Pteranodon longiceps</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ. Sci.
xi, p. 508, June 1875; xxvii, p. 424, pl. xv, May 1884.</p>

<p>Based upon a somewhat defective skull, without other bones.
There is no evidence whatever that the species is distinct from the
preceding.</p>

<p class="blockquot2"> <i>Pteranodon comptus</i> Marsh, Amer. Journ. Sci.
xi, p. 509, June 1876.</p>

<p>Based upon wing-bones of three individuals. The description is meagre.</p>

p. 343, April 1881.</p>

<h3>PTERANODON.</h3>

<h4>Skull.</h4>

<p>Fragmentary portions of the skull of Pteranodon are not at all rare
in the Kansas chalk; but it is exceedingly seldom that a complete,
or even approximately complete specimen is found. Their great length
and slenderness, together with the extensive pneumaticity of the
bones, render their preservation, as a whole, a thing of great rarity.
Probably the most nearly perfect one yet known is now in the Museum
of Kansas University. It was discovered the past summer by Mr. E. C.
Case, a member of the University Geological Expedition. The specimen
was carefully cleaned on its upper surface, as it lay in the chalk, and
then imbedded in plaster before removal. The surface now exposed was
the under one, which surface is, almost invariably, better preserved
and less distorted than the upper one in these animals. A figure of
this specimen is given in Plate I. The only portion restored is that
indicated by the line in the lower jaw; it is possible that this part
of the symphysis may not be exactly as it is drawn. Other, incomplete,
specimens in the Museum confirm the outlines, except in the occipital
crest, which is not present. As stated by me in the American Naturalist
(<i>l. c.</i>), the type specimen of <i>Pteranodon</i>, also collected by myself,
was incomplete, and the figures of it, as given by Marsh, are faulty.</p>

<p>The elements of the skull are all so firmly united that they can
not be distinguished. There are no indications whatever of a horny
sheath enclosing the jaw, and it is improbable that the covering of
these parts was essentially different from that in the slender jawed
<i>Pterodactylidae</i>. In texture, the maxillaries are fine-grained, and
wholly without the vascular foramina found in the corresponding bones
of birds. The bones are composed of two thin and firm plates, separated
by cavities which are bounded by irregular walls of bony tissue. In the
compression from which all the Pterodactyl bones have suffered more or
less, the greater resistance of these walls has caused irregularities
upon both the outer and the inner surfaces. At the borders of the
bones, where the thickness has been greater, the roughening is not observed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Seen from above, the skull is narrow, as stated by Marsh; but, contrary
to his statement, there is not a sharp ridge extending along the
upper border. This border is obtuse and rounded, and in the frontal
region, flattened. The sagittal crest is large, but not nearly so
large as it is figured by Marsh, the restored outline of whose figure
is undoubtedly wrong. The texture of the bone forming the crest is
materially different from that of the remaining bones of the skull.
The bone is more roughened, and less firm. There is a well-developed
ring of sclerotic ossifications. In the specimen figured, the separate
plates measure from six to eight millimeters in diameter. They were
not imbricated, as in the Pythonomorpha, but have a similar dense
texture. There is a superior temporal arch, bridging over a small
opening leading downward to the inferior temporal fossa. The following
measurements will give the principal dimensions of this specimen.</p>

<h4>Pubis.</h4>

<p>In a previous paper on the anatomy of <i>Pteranodon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
I stated that I had never seen the so-called “prepubic bones.” Since
that time, however, an excellent specimen of them has been discovered
among our material. The specimen of which they are a part consists
of the larger portion of the skeleton, and is perhaps conspecific
with the one to which the described pelvis belongs. The figure given
herewith will convey a good idea of their shape. The bones of the two
sides are firmly co-ossified, and have been pressed nearly flat; the
figure represents them as they are spread out in one plane. The bone
is very thin throughout, with a slight thickening at the ischial (<i>a</i>)
attachment only. Lying contiguous with the anterior projection, is a
slender ventral rib (<i>b</i>). It is possible that the curvature of this
bone may be inward, rather than outward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
This peculiar structure of the pubis (I believe it represents the
pubis, and not the prepubis), seems to be quite similar to that
which obtains in the genus <i>Rhamphorhynchus</i>, and, perhaps also, in
<i>Pterodactylus suevicus</i> (<i>Cycnorhamphus</i> Seeley), and very different
from that found in other species of <i>Pterodactylus</i>.</p>

<h3>NYCTODACTYLUS.</h3>

<p>The type species of this genus was described as follows by its author (loc. cit. supra):</p>

<p class="blockquot1"> “One of the smallest American species yet found
is represented in the Yale Museum by several bones of the wing, a
number of vertebrae and the nearly complete pelvis. The wing-bones
preserved are elongated and very slender. The pelvis is unusually
small, and there are five vertebrae in the sacrum. The last of the
series indicates that the tail was short. The following are the
principal measurements of this specimen: </p>

<p>This species, which may be called <i>Pteranodon gracilis</i>, was about
two-thirds the size of <i>P. velox</i> Marsh. It probably measured about ten
feet between the tips of the expanded wings.”</p>

Science, he described the genus as follows:

This genus is nearly related to <i>Pteranodon</i>, but may be readily
distinguished from it by the scapular arch, in which the coracoid
is not co-ossified with the scapula. The latter bone, moreover, has
no articulation at its distal end, which is comparatively thin and
expanded. The type of this species is <i>Pteranodon gracilis</i> Marsh,
which may now be called <i>Nyctosaurus gracilis</i>. It was a Pterodactyl of
medium size, measuring about eight to ten feet between the tips of the
expanded wings.” </p>

<p>The specific description of this species rests solely upon the
measurements; the other characters given are not only vague, but are
also common to all the known species. The generic description, as it is
seen, is based upon the structure of the coraco-scapula. It will also
be observed that the characters are not drawn from the type specimen,
as that did not include this part of the skeleton, according to the
author’s statement. Of these two characters, the non-ossification
of the coracoid and scapula is a somewhat doubtful one, as the same
character may or may not occur in allied species, as, for example, in
the species of <i>Rhamphorhyncus</i> (<i>R. Muensteri</i> Goldf.) described
by the author himself. So incomplete and unsatisfactory are the characters
thus given that Zittel, in his Handbuch, dismisses the genus with the
brief remark, “noch unbeschrieben.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from the peculiar form of the scapula, and from my
recollection of the specimens upon which the genus was based, I
believe I have determined with certainty an excellent specimen in the
Snow Museum of Kansas University as a member of it, and here give a
sufficiently complete description to place the genus on a more secure
foundation.</p>

<p>This specimen was collected by Professor E. E. Slosson, of Wyoming
University, while a member of my party in western Kansas the past
season. It was partly exposed upon a gently sloping surface of firm
yellow chalk on the Smoky Hill river, in the vicinity of Monument
Rocks. Originally, the nearly complete skeleton must have been
preserved, but a number of the bones had been either wholly or
partially washed away, in some cases leaving their imprint in the
chalk. The bones uncovered, and now lying upon the chalk slab nearly
in their natural relations, are a humerus, both radii and ulnae, a
pteroid, the two carpals of one wrist, both wing metacarpals, a first
and a last wing phalanx, both coraco-scapulae, the posterior part of
the lower jaws, ilium, femur, sternum, numerous ribs and vertebrae. The
two coraco-scapulae lie with their scapular ends nearly touching, and
their coracoid ends separated by a space equivalent to the width of the
sternal articulation. The two elements appear to have been imperfectly
united and were probably not co-ossified. The inferior border of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
coracoid, near the humeral articulation, has a greater expansion than
is found in <i>Pteranodon</i>; its shaft is more rounded and less rugose,
lacking especially the strong muscular markings upon the external
surface. The articular surface does not appear to differ materially
from that in <i>Pteranodon</i>. The scapula is of nearly the same length
as the coracoid, but is much less stout. It is a thin, spatulate
bone, slightly expanded at the distal extremity, where the margin is
rounded, and without the characteristic oblique articular facet. It
has no supra-glenoid expansion or process on the posterior proximal
border, but has its margin nearly straight or gently concave from the
articulation to its extremity. The space included between the bones
of the two sides as they lie is a nearly regular, oval one, measuring
ninety-five millimeters in its greater, forty-five in its lesser diameter.</p>

<p>The sternum lies at a little distance from the coraco-scapulae. It is
an extremely thin bone, with a stout anterior, styliform projection,
at the base of which, on either side, looking upward and outward,
is the articular, trochlea-like surface for the sternal end of the
coracoid. The width between these articular surfaces measures fifteen
millimeters; the length of the process in front of the articulations
is twenty-five millimeters. Immediately posterior to the articular
surfaces, the bone expands nearly at right angles to the longitudinal
axis to a width of about sixty millimeters. The thin lateral margins
are nearly parallel with the longitudinal axis, and show three shallow
emarginations between the four costal articular projections. The
hind angles are nearly rectangular. The bone, as preserved, is only
shallowly concave, and shows no true keel, though a more pronounced
median convexity towards the front doubtless subserved the function of
a carina in part.</p>

<p>The left humerus lies in position, and is especially characterized by
its enormous deltoid crest (radial crest of Marsh), though otherwise
slender. This crest is further removed from the head of the bone
than is the case in species of <i>Pteranodon</i>. It is directed somewhat
downward, and has its distal, gently convex, border about twenty-five
millimeters in extent, while the width of the process midway between
the extremity and the base measures but sixteen millimeters. The
bicipital crest is also prominent. The bone is relatively shorter than
in <i>Pteranodon</i>.</p>

<p>The humerus, as will be seen from the above description, and from
the measurements given below, is remarkably like the same bone in
<i>Pteranodon nanus</i>, as described by Marsh (<i>l. c. supra</i>), and but
a little larger. In <i>P. nanus</i>, however, the coracoid and scapula are
said to be firmly co-ossified, and the scapula has of course a different structure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The skull has been, unfortunately, almost wholly washed away, a
fragment of the cranial wall and the posterior part of the lower jaws
alone remaining. It is impossible, hence, to say much concerning this
part of the anatomy. The lower jaws show a different structure from
that in <i>Pteranodon</i>. As they lie in their natural position, the width
at the condyles is about twenty-four millimeters. The angular is less
produced posterior to the articulation than in <i>Pteranodon</i>, indicating
a less elongated and less powerful mandibular portion, an indication
further borne out by the slenderness of the rami. The impression in
the chalk shows the symphysis to begin ninety millimeters from the
articulation. The width at this place could not have exceeded sixteen
millimeters; and the entire length of the lower jaws could hardly
have been more than one hundred and twenty-five millimeters. In the
parts preserved, measuring seventy-five millimeters, there are no
indications of teeth; yet it is not impossible that there may have been
teeth in the anterior portion of the dentary, as in some species of
<i>Pterodactylus</i>. I hardly think it probable, however.</p>

<p>There are seven cervical vertebrae preserved, apparently the full
complement, as in <i>Pteranodon</i> and other members of the order. They
differ in no especial respect from the corresponding vertebrae of
<i>Pteranodon</i>, and, apparently, of <i>Pterodactylus</i>. The imperfectly
anchylosed, possibly free, atlas shows three pieces, the odontoid
process and the two slender lateral pieces. The lateral pieces are
entirely free, with a thickened base and a slender, curved upper
portion. The odontoid is gently concave in front, and seems to be
imperfectly ossified with the axis; it occupies the lower part of the
articulation, corresponding to the hypapophysis of the Pythonomorpha.
The axis is the shortest of the remaining vertebrae, and has a well
developed spine. The centrum is strongly convex behind, as are the
remaining centra of the series. The following five vertebrae decrease
gradually in length. The anterior ones have only a thin ridge or plate
for the neural spine; the seventh, however, has a neurapophysis of
some length. They are all, as is usually the case, somewhat distorted
from pressure. The under side is flattened, apparently gently concave
longitudinally, and with a lateral ridge terminating in an obtuse
hypapophysis at each inferior hind angle.</p>

<p>In his discussion of the Pterosauria, Zittel says concerning the
vertebrae: “zwischen oberen Bogen und Centrum ist keine Sutur zu
bemerken.” Handbuch, iii, p. 776. In this he is in error, so far as
the American forms are concerned. It is usually the case in the Kansas
specimens of both genera that the neural arch of the post-cervical
vertebrae is wholly or in part detached from the centrum, showing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sutural, and not anchylosed union in life. The centra of twelve
vertebrae are preserved, in the present specimen, from the region back
of the neck; in only five of them are the neural arches in any way
attached. Three of these are evidently anterior thoracic, judging from
their structure and the position in which they lie. The shortest of
them, to which was attached a very large rib, and which was lying in
front of the scapulae, may represent the first thoracic vertebra (<i>a</i>).
Its centrum is fully as wide as long, is flat on the under surface,
and has a large, stout, horizontal parapophysis near the anterior end.
Just above this process for the attachment of the head of the rib,
and separated by a deep notch, is a much more elongated, horizontal
diapophysis for the tuberculum. The cup of the centrum is shallowly
concave; the transverse, shallowly U-shaped ball is only a little convex.</p>

<p>Two other vertebrae (<i>b</i>), found close by the one just described, and
possibly one or the other contiguous with it, differ remarkably in
having no, or a rudimentary, parapophysial process, and in having the
diapophyses much shorter. It is not impossible that a slight expansion
at the lateral margins of the ball may represent small parapophyses.
In <i>Pteranodon</i> there are at least four vertebrae with dia- and
parapophyses. In the other vertebrae from this region the diapophyses
are yet shorter and the neural spine stouter and broader. The other
centra preserved are all shaped somewhat like the half of a cylinder,
and are a little longer than broad. They have no distinct cup or ball.
In two of them there is a very long, recurved parapophysial process,
as though formed by an anchylosed rib, on each side; they are probably
lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>Most of the ribs are very slender; a few are moderately thickened; one
only is very stout; its measurements are given below.</p>

<p>The principal dimensions of this species can be got at with
considerable certainty. Although two of the wing-phalanges and the
bones of the foot are wanting, yet the relative proportions of those
present agree so closely with those of the corresponding bones in
<i>Pteranodon</i>, that there can be but little possibility of error in
assuming the same proportions for the missing ones. The position of the
ilium and femur, as also the ribs, show that they hold their natural
relations to the pectoral arch. The tail, alone, can not be got at.

<p>But one species has been described from the American Cretaceous smaller
than the present one, <i>Pteranodon nanus</i> Marsh, in which the expanse of
wings is given as not more than three or four feet. In this estimate
the author is certainly in error. The size of the humerus, as given,
is rather more than three-fourths that of the present species, and the
expanse, hence, must be nearly five feet in life, or six feet as the
bones lie outstretched.</p>

<p>As regards the specific determination of the present specimen, there
must necessarily be some doubt until the species already named have
been recognizably described. But three of the existing species can be
taken into account, <i>N. gracilis</i>, <i>P. comptus</i> and <i>P. nanus</i>.
That it can not be the last, has already been shown. In size, it agrees well
with <i>P. comptus</i>, but the other characters throw no light upon the identity.</p>

<p>The measurements given of the type specimen of <i>N. gracilis</i> show the
size to be materially greater,—a character, however, of subordinate
value—greater slenderness, and a relatively shorter first wing-phalanx.</p>

<p>The relative lengths of wing-metacarpals, wing-phalanx and ulna in <i>N.
gracilis</i> and the present specimen may be expressed as follows:</p>

<p>It will be seen that not a single character has yet been given to
distinguish the genus from <i>Pterodactylus</i>, and it is not at all
impossible that it may prove to be the same; its location among the
<i>Pteranodontidae</i> rests solely on the assumed absence of teeth,
and that is a character yet wholly unknown.</p>

<p>The material now in the museum permits a fuller discussion of the
relations and characters of this group of reptiles than has been
hitherto attempted. Originally, they were described as constituting a
new order, a view still held by its author and no one else. Lydekker,
in his Paleontology and Catalogue gives them a subordinal value; Zittel
only a family value, though expressing doubt as to their subordinal rank.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems very probable that the genus <i>Nyctodactylus</i> has no teeth
in the jaws; it agrees in <i>every other respect</i> with the genus
<i>Pterodactylus</i>, so far as known. If the genus has teeth it must be
united with <i>Pterodactylus</i>. Now, in not a few species of this genus,
the teeth are confined to the anterior end of the jaws, and their
entire absence, unaccompanied by other structural differences, will
hardly constitute an order, or even family.</p>

<p>But, leaving aside <i>Nyctodactylus</i>, it is very much of a question
whether the differences between <i>Pterodactylus</i> and <i>Pteranodon</i> are
sufficient to locate them in different families, let alone different suborders.</p>

<p>The two genera have the following in common: Tail short. Skull with
more or less elongated, pointed jaws, and very small upper and lower
temporal fossae. Narial opening large, confluent with the pre-orbital
foramen. Cervical vertebrae elongated, with rudimentary spinous
processes. Fore and hind extremities, quite alike.</p>

<p><i>Pteranodon</i> differs from <i>Pterodactylus</i>, so far as that genus
is known, in the united coracoscapulae and pubes, both of which characters
are found in <i>Rhamphorhynchus</i>.</p>

<p>The sole family characters remaining then, for <i>Pteranodon</i>, are,
absence of teeth, a supra-occipital crest, and the articulation of
the upper end of the scapula. Now it seems evident that to place
the pteranodonts in a group equivalent to all the other pterosaurs
is unwarranted, and any classification that will not show the more
pronounced relationships with <i>Pterodactylus</i> is faulty. I would,
therefore, propose the following:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="ifrst">Order Pterosauria.</li>
<li class="isub3">Family Pterodactylidae,</li>
<li class="isub6">subfamilies Pteranodontinae, Pterodactylinae.</li>
<li class="isub3">Family Rhamphorhynchidae.</li>
<li class="isub3">Family Ornithocheiridae.</li>
</ul>

<p>As regards the geographical distribution of the Pteranodonts, they
have hitherto been recognized only from Kansas, but I am firmly of the
opinion that they occur in Europe, and, if so, it is very probable that
the name <i>Pteranodon</i> must be eventually given up. In fact, a toothless
form of Pterodactyl was described by Seeley as long ago as 1871,
under the name of <i>Ornithostoma</i>. I cannot refer to his description
at present, and can, therefore, give no opinion as to their identity.
It seems certain that the peculiar form of the scapulae and their
vertebral articulation<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
occur among some of the European forms, which would strengthen the belief
that <i>Pteranodon</i> is also an European genus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of the above, the practice of the American text-books in
Geology in introducing generic names of characteristic fossils as names
of the geological horizons whence they come, is very reprehensible, in
my opinion. Even the late edition of Leconte’s Elements contains a long
list of such names, the greater portion of which have been relegated to
the limbo of synonymy by paleontologists. It is greatly to be desired
that the name “Pteranodon Beds” shall not become established, so long
as there is the least doubt of the validity of the name itself.</p>

<p>The group of extinct Cretaceous reptiles known as the Mosasaurs or
Pythonomorpha was defined by Cope, “to whom Science is so largely
indebted for its present knowledge of this interesting order of
reptiles” (Marsh), in 1869.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Although some of the characters assigned by him to the order have
since been shown to be inapplicable, and the group to have less value,
yet his name, Pythonomorpha, has been generally retained. Lydekker
and Zittel have assigned to the group a subordinal value, as has also
Marsh, though under a different name. Owen rejected it entirely, and
Baur, more recently,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
has united it with the Varanidae to form a super-family, as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">Suborder Platynota.</li>
<li class="isub6">Super-family Varanoidea.</li>
<li class="isub6">Families Mosasauridae, Varanidae.</li>
<li class="isub3">Super-family Helodermatoidea.</li>
<li class="isub6">Family Helodermatidae.</li>
</ul>

<p>The group, whatever may be its rank or position, includes, so far, the
following genera: <i>Mosasaurus</i> Conyb., <i>Liodon</i> Owen, <i>Platecarpus</i>
Cope, <i>Clidastes</i> Cope, <i>Baptosaurus</i> Marsh, <i>Sironectes</i> Cope,
<i>Plioplatecarpus</i> Dollo and <i>Hainosaurus</i> Dollo. <i>Pterycollasaurus</i>
Dollo, founded upon <i>Mosasaurus maximilianus</i> Goldf., is omitted
as doubtful. All of these genera, save <i>Plioplatecarpus</i> and
<i>Hainosaurus</i>, have been recorded from North America, <i>Clidastes</i>,
<i>Baptosaurus</i> and <i>Sironectes</i> being peculiar to this country. Of these
latter three genera, however, <i>Clidastes</i> alone is well known; but this
genus is suspected by Lydekker of being the same as the imperfectly
known European <i>Geosaurus</i> Cuvier. Thus it seems that the genera, or
at least the most of them, have a wide distribution; <i>Platecarpus</i>, in
fact, is said to occur in New Zealand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In America, members of the group have been discovered in the Cretaceous
deposits of New Jersey, Alabama, North Carolina, the upper Missouri
region, Nebraska, Kansas and New Mexico. Probably nineteen-twentieths
of all the known specimens, however, have been obtained in western
Kansas. The material now in the University Museum, all from Kansas,
comprises several hundred specimens of these animals, including,
probably, the best ones known. It is upon this material that the
following preliminary studies are chiefly based.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Clidastes</i>, as first described by Cope, was based upon
two dorsal vertebrae of <i>C. iguanavus</i>, the type species, from New
Jersey. Shortly afterward, however, he gave a full and careful generic
description, as derived from an unusually good specimen of an allied
species, <i>C. propython</i>, from Alabama. Only a little later, Marsh
described a genus, which he called <i>Edestosaurus</i>, from Kansas, but
without giving any real, distinctive differences from <i>Clidastes</i>,
following the very reprehensible practice of naming supposed new forms
in the hopes that future distinctive characters might be found. The
genus <i>Edestosaurus</i> has been rejected by nearly all save the authors
of the American text-books in Geology. It seems hardly necessary to
point out the identity. The only distinctive character the author
gave for his genus was the insertion of the pterygoid teeth, and even
this character he modified later—“Palatine (sic) teeth more or less
pleurodont.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This character, even were it real, is of very slight value; indeed it
cannot be used to distinguish the species even.</p>

<p><i>Clidastes</i> is, without doubt, one of the most highly specialized
genera in the group, and, what is very interesting, is one of the
latest. It occurs in Kansas in the uppermost part of the Niobrara beds,
in the horizon so markedly characterized by the toothed birds. Both
<i>Platecarpus</i> and <i>Liodon</i> occur, though in diminished numbers, almost
to the very lowest portion, but <i>Clidastes</i> has never been found except
towards the top. From measurements made the past season, the thickness
of the beds in which these saurians occur cannot be less than six
hundred feet.</p>

<p>The following species have been found in Kansas: none of them are known
to occur elsewhere.</p>

<h3>CLIDASTES VELOX.</h3>

<p>A remarkably complete specimen, referred with considerable certainty
to this species, was obtained by ourselves in western Kansas, (Butte
Creek) in the summer of 1891. A brief preliminary description of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
specimen was given by the senior author in Science, December 8, 1891.
A more complete description is here given, which, it is believed, will
be of service. The specimen is an unusually perfect one, being very
nearly complete, and, as now mounted, shows the bones nearly all in the
position in which they were found. The vertebral column is continuous,
except in one place, where the tail had been bent up over the back; and
complete, save at the very tip of the tail. The skull is complete, or
very nearly complete, and has been restored nearly to the condition in
life. Figures have been made of this portion of the skeleton, and will
be given in a future communication. At present, it may be mentioned
that the lacrymals are small, roughly irregular bones, and pointed at
either extremity. There are no indications of transverse bones, as
there are none in any other skull in the collection.</p>

<h4>Cervical vertebrae.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Atlas.</span> The intercentrum is a small bone with three
sides of nearly equal extent. The two upper, articular surfaces are gently
concave, and meet in a rounded margin; the inferior surface is convex,
both antero-posteriorly and transversely, with a roughened prominence
in the middle. The lateral pieces have indistinctly separated facets
for articulation with the odontoid, the intercentrum and the occipital
condyle. The rather short, flattened lamina extends upward, backward
and inward, approaching, but not reaching its fellow of the opposite
side; it is somewhat dilated distally. Directed outwards and forwards,
there is a stout styliform process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Axis.</span> The neural spine of the axis is elongated
antero-posteriorly. It is thin on the anterior portion, but stouter
and longer at the posterior part. The large, stout odontoid process is
united suturally, as is also the well-developed atlantar hypapophysis,
which forms the anterior, inferior portion of the bone. The diapophyses
are the smallest of the costiferous series, with only a small articular
facet for the rib. The ball is strongly and evenly convex, with its
greater diameter transversely. The hypapophysis is the largest of the
series; it is suturally united with the stout, exogenous process of the
centrum, and projects downward and backward; its distal extremity is
roughened for ligamentous attachments.</p>

<p>The third cervical vertebra shows a well-developed zygosphenal
articulation, and stout articular processes. The transverse process is
small, only a little larger than that of the axis, though, unlike that,
it is strengthened by a ridge continued from the anterior zygapophyses.
The hypapophysis is smaller than that of the axis, but, like that,
is directed downward and backward. The spine may be distinguished
from that of any other vertebra by its stout, trihedral shape; it is
directed rather more obliquely backward than in the following vertebrae.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth cervical vertebra differs from the third in having stouter
transverse processes; in the hypapophysis being directed more nearly
downward, and in its smaller size; and in the spine being flattened
antero-posteriorly toward the base.</p>

<p>The fifth cervical vertebra differs from the fourth in the broader
spine, in the stouter transverse processes, and the smaller hypapophysis.</p>

<p>In the sixth cervical vertebra, the hypapophysis is reduced to a small
ossification, scarcely longer than broad, directed downward. The spine
has reached nearly the full width of those of the following vertebrae,
though somewhat stouter above. The transverse processes are yet stouter.</p>

<p>In the seventh, or last, cervical vertebra the hypapophysis is wanting,
or very rudimentary. The under part of the centrum shows a rounded ridge
or carina, with a slight projection corresponding to the hypapophysis.</p>

<h4>Dorsal vertebrae.</h4>

<p>There are thirty-five vertebrae between the cervicals and the first
non-rib-bearing vertebra, to which the pelvis was, evidently, attached.
The distinction between the cervicals and thoracics cannot be made from
any characters they possess, as the seventh vertebra does not bear a
distinct hypapophysis. Neither can it be said with certainty from this
specimen which is the first thoracic vertebra, as the cervical ribs
had, unfortunately, been displaced in the collection and preparation
of the specimen. In another specimen, referred to <i>C. pumilus</i>, and
which, as will be seen later, cannot be specifically distinguished
from the present species, short cervical ribs were found attached to
six vertebrae posterior to the atlas. That the eighth vertebra is a
thoracic one is shown by the relation of the ribs in this specimen.
Posteriorly there is no distinction, also, between the true thoracic
vertebrae and those of the lumbar region. All the vertebrae anterior to
the pelvis bear ribs, and will all be considered as dorsal vertebrae,
the true thoracic vertebrae being restricted to those of which the ribs
are elongated, and, probably, connected with the sternum.</p>

<p>In the anterior vertebrae of the series, the centra are subcarinate
below, the obtuse, rounded ridge becoming less and less apparent
until no indications of the keel can be seen, before the middle
of the series. The transverse processes are stoutest, with a more
elongated, sigmoid articular surface, with little or no constriction,
and projecting only slightly beyond the stout articulating processes,
in the anterior vertebrae. In the tenth or eleventh, the articular
surface has become markedly smaller, more vertical, and less sigmoid in
outline. Thence to the last, the articular surface for the ribs remains
nearly the same. The process itself, however, becomes gradually more
prominent and constricted, as the zygapophyses becomes smaller. The
spinous processes increase slightly in length and breadth, and are only
slightly oblique throughout. In length, the centra increase gradually.
The vertical diameter of the ball increases gradually, while the
transverse diameter remains more nearly the same.

<h4>Caudal vertebrae.</h4>

<p>Immediately following the thirty-fifth rib-bearing vertebra there is
an abrupt change, the tubercular process for the rib giving place to
an elongated transverse process. From the position of the pelvis, it
is evident that the ilia were attached to the first pair of these.
Precisely this relation of pelvis to the vertebrae is found in such
lizards as the Monitor and Iguana, and it is probable that such is the
relation in all the Pythonomorpha. It will thus be seen that there
are no distinctively lumbar vertebrae, if by such are meant free,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
non-costiferous, pre-sacral vertebrae. The vertebrae of these animals
that have been so designated by writers are in reality basal caudal.
A distinctive term for them—those with transverse, non-costiferous
processes and without chevrons—is needed, and we propose,
provisionally, the term <i>pygial</i>. There are seven in the present
series, all characterized by elongated transverse processes, and not
differing much from each other. The vertebrae lie in the matrix with
the ventral aspect uppermost, concealing the spine and upper parts.
The under surface is somewhat flattened, and, as in the preceding
vertebrae, is gently concave antero-posteriorly. The transverse
processes are elongate, stout towards the base, apparently all of
nearly equal length, and directed gently backwards and downwards. In
the anterior vertebrae the processes spring from near the front part:
as the centra become shorter they arise from near the middle. In the
last one of the series there are minute indications of chevrons.</p>

<p>The centra of those caudal vertebrae which have chevrons do not differ
much in shape. They become less constricted, and, back of the middle of
the series, are smoothly cylindrical in shape. The transverse processes
decrease gradually in length, disappearing entirely in the twenty-fifth
or twenty-sixth. The spinous processes are more or less incompletely
preserved in the anterior vertebrae. They increase only gradually in
length for the first twenty of the series, and are markedly oblique,
with the posterior border stout, and the anterior border alate. With
the twenty-sixth they begin to increase more rapidly in length, and
have become more nearly vertical in position, and are thinner at each
margin. In the thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth they attain their greatest
length, and are here directed slightly forwards. Thence to the end of
the tail, the length decreases gradually, and, in position, they are
directed more and more obliquely backward. The chevrons are strongly
oblique throughout the series and are firmly co-ossified with the centrum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The tail, it is thus seen, has a broad, vertical, fin-like extremity, which,
doubtless, aided much in the propulsion of the animal through the water.</p>

<p>There are sixty-seven vertebrae with chevrons present in the specimen,
all continuous, except in one place. The last one is less than
one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and shows that there had been yet
another, possibly several more. Toward the base of the series the tail
has been bent forwards over the back, and it is possible that, where
the break occurs, there has been a vertebra lost. The measurements,
however, do not seem to indicate any loss. The entire series of
vertebrae was not less than sixty-eight, and probably not more than
seventy, making for the entire vertebral series one hundred and
seventeen to twenty.</p>

<h4>Ribs.</h4>

<p>As has already been stated, the cervical ribs were displaced in the
present specimen, and measurements of them cannot be given. In a
smaller specimen, specifically indistinguishable from the present one,
the entire cervical series is preserved with the ribs attached. The
first, that articulating with the axis, is very short. The following
ones are stouter, but increase only moderately in length, that of the
sixth measuring only thirty-five millimeters, while that of the seventh
is but a little longer. In the specimen of <i>C. velox</i> described,
there is a detached cervical rib sixty-five millimeters in length; it
probably belongs with the seventh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The thoracic ribs are simple, somewhat flattened rods, moderately
expanded at the proximal end. The greatest convexity is shown about the
middle of the series, where the versedsine of the curvature is forty
millimeters, the chord being one hundred and sixty. Posteriorly, the
short ribs are only gently curved.</p>

<p>Lying by the side of the vertebral column, and between the ribs,
as they have been pressed down, are a number of flattened, soft,
punctulate bones, which are evidently the costal cartilages.
Posteriorly four rows of them are seen, lying closely side by side,
some of them eight or ten inches in length. The sternum, composed
of the same material, has been so crushed and crumpled that its
shape cannot be made out. The whole structure here, whether of ribs,
cartilages or sternum, reminds one very strongly of such lizards as the
Iguana or Monitor. There is no indication, however, in any specimen, of
an episternum.</p>

<h4>Limbs.</h4>

<p>The figures in plates II and III will give a sufficiently good idea
of the limbs in this specimen. They are figured as they were lying,
showing the outer sides of the coracoid, scapula and pelvic bones, and
the palmar or plantar surface of the remaining bones.</p>

<h4>Coracoid.</h4>

<p>It will be observed in plates II and IV that there are two very
different types of coracoid, one with a deep emargination, the other
without the slightest indication of such. The same non-emarginate
form occurs in <i>C. tortor</i>, as specimens in our Museum show, in
<i>C. propython</i> Cope (Ext. Batr. etc. pl. xii, f. 16,) and in <i>C. dispar</i>,
as figured by Marsh<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,
and as stated by him in the same paper (“There is certainly no
emargination in the coracoid of <i>Clidastes</i>, <i>Edestosaurus</i> and
<i>Baptosaurus</i>, as specimens in the Yale Museum conclusively prove.”) It
is true that Marsh in a later paper<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
figured a specimen with emarginate coracoid under the name of
<i>Edestosaurus dispar</i>, but it is certain that his identification of his
own species was wrong, as will be seen by comparing his figures. From
the senior author’s memory of the specimen with the emarginate coracoid
figured, and from the figure itself he feels confident that the second
specimen is <i>C. velox</i>.</p>

<p>That the emargination was overlooked by the author seems strange, as
in the same paper in which this figure is given occurs the description
of <i>Holosaurus, founded upon that very character</i>. If the emargination
is sufficiently important to base a genus in the one case, then it
should be in the other, and the character could not be applied to
<i>Edestosaurus</i>, based upon characters which it hardly seems possible
that the author himself could seriously consider, for <i>E. dispar</i> was
the type of <i>Edestosaurus</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed, further, that the figured coracoids differ very
materially in size, those with the emargination pertaining to a small
species, while <i>C. dispar</i> is one of the largest. In our Museum there
are three specimens with the emarginate coracoid, all of them small or
very small, the described specimen of <i>C. velox</i> being the largest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The point of chief interest in this relation is the value that can be
given to this character. Is it individual, specific or generic? Marsh
has called it generic, but we think an examination of the two very
complete specimens of <i>C. tortor</i> and <i>C. velox</i> in our Museum will
convince any unprejudiced student that he is in error.</p>

<p>A comparison of the figures herewith given of the paddles will show
their great resemblance, and these two forms of paddles have been
figured because the species are the most unlike of any that we know in
the genus. As all the small specimens seem to possess this character,
and as they cannot be called immature specimens, we believe the
character is a specific one. As Marsh says, typically both <i>Clidastes</i>
and <i>Edestosaurus</i> have a non-emarginate coracoid, so that neither name
could apply to the emarginate form, were it generically distinct.</p>

<p>Our Museum also contains both forms of the coracoid pertaining to the
genus <i>Platecarpus</i>, of which <i>Holosaurus</i> is a synonym.</p>

<p>While studying the specimen above described, a striking similarity was
observed to several other specimens already determined with confidence
as <i>C. pumilus</i> Marsh. A more careful comparison failed to bring out
any real differences beyond size, and even this was shown to be very inconstant.</p>

<p>The following comparison of the descriptions given by Marsh will be of interest.</p>

<p>The description, otherwise, shows no discrepancies of importance. The
chief difference given by the author is the size, and this character
we think our specimens show to be of little specific value. “It
is a question of some importance how far difference in size among
the Mosasauroids may be a test of difference in species. Among the
numerous remains of these animals which have been discovered I have
never yet observed any which presented any evidence relative to age.
* * * In this view of the case, some of the many described species of
Mosasauroids may have been founded on different sizes of the same.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The length of the cervical vertebrae in the specimen above described
is thirty-seven or thirty-eight millimeters. The cervical vertebrae in
two specimens referred to <i>C. pumilus</i> have lengths respectively of
twenty-two and thirty millimeters. In the type specimen of <i>C. velox</i>
they must have had a length of at least forty-two millimeters.</p>

<p>It thus appears that, between the smallest specimen, which, in life,
could have hardly exceeded eight feet in length, our specimens,
indistinguishable anatomically, represent forms of ten and twelve feet,
while the type itself was about fifteen feet in length.</p>

<p>Of the material originally referred to <i>C. pumilus</i>, there are in the
collection five or more specimens, which, altogether, furnish nearly
every part of the skeleton. They present no tangible differences from
the skeleton of <i>C. velox</i> described above. There can be, hence, little
or no doubt but that the name <i>C. pumilus</i> is a synonym.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to say with certainty that <i>C. affinis</i> Leidy
is or is not the same as <i>C. velox</i>, but, so far as the description
goes, we can find few differences. The type is of about the same size
as the type of <i>C. velox</i>, and the figures agree well with the bones
of the skeleton described. Although the description was not published
till 1873, the author makes no mention of the species of Marsh’s. Leidy
describes the back teeth as having the enamel strongly striated, with
the surface presenting evidences of subdivision into narrow planes. In
this respect, only, it disagrees with the specimen.</p>

<p><i>Plioplatecarpus</i> Dollo is described by its author as having a sacrum
of two conjoined vertebrae,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
by reason of which it is placed in a separate family from the rest of
the <i>Pythonomorpha</i>. It may be presumptuous to express a doubt of the
genuineness of the sacrum, and yet, save from the fact that the author
found two specimens quite alike, one might doubt it strongly. It is
not very rare that two, or even three vertebrae are found united from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
injury in these animals, and such would readily account for the
consolidation as figured and described by Dollo, except for the
coincidence of the second specimen. A stronger reason for doubt is
the statement that the consolidated vertebrae belong to the posterior
“lumbar” region, and that the last vertebrae had small tubercles
indicative of chevrons. In the reptiles which we have examined, the
chevrons do not begin immediately behind the pelvis, but are separated
by a longer or shorter region in which the vertebrae bear elongated
diapophyses alone. If the conjoined vertebrae figured by Dollo are in
reality sacral, it would appear that the animal is an exception to
<i>Clidastes</i> and such lizards as we have examined. Furthermore, the
pelvis must have been of a different structure from that in the Kansas
genera of the Pythonomorpha, for, in these, it is evident that the
ilium had an oblique position, and could have been attached to but a
single diapophysis.</p>

<h3>CLIDASTES WESTII, N. SP.</h3>

<p>A specimen of much interest in the University collection differs so
markedly from the other forms represented by specimens, as also from
the descriptions of the known species, that we are constrained to
regard it as new. It was collected by Mr. C. H. Sternberg from the
uppermost of the Niobrara beds, in the vicinity of the old town of
Sheridan. The character of the associated invertebrate fossils seems
to indicate a different geological horizon, either the Fox Hills
group, or transition beds to that group. The specimen consists of a
complete lower jaw, quadrate, portions of the skull, the larger part
of the vertebral column, and the incomplete hind and fore paddles. The
vertebrae preserved are in two series, the one, numbering thirty-three,
continuous with the skull; the other, sixty-three in number, all
chevron caudals. The terminal caudals preserved indicate that there
were several more in life, perhaps five or ten; the first of the series
was evidently among the first of those which bore chevrons. Altogether
the tail may have had seventy-five chevron caudals. The lengths of
the two series are respectively seventy-one and seventy-two inches.
Assuming that there was the same number of precaudal vertebrae as in
<i>C. velox</i>, the entire vertebral column would have measured in life
fifteen feet and four inches. The lower jaw shows the skull to have
been very nearly twenty-four inches in length, making, for the animal
when alive, a length of seventeen and one-half feet. This is one of
the largest species, and it is interesting to observe that the real
size here, as usually elsewhere among fossil vertebrates, is less than
supposed. It is doubtful whether there is a <i>Clidastes</i> known that
exceeded twenty feet in length.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>While the skeleton was only about one half longer than the specimen
of <i>C. velox</i> described in the foregoing pages, or of about the same
length as a very complete specimen of <i>C. tortor</i> in the museum, the
proportions of the animal were very much stouter. The figures given in
plate VI of the twenty-fifth, or eighteenth dorsal, vertebra will show
the relations between length and breadth: it is upon these remarkably
stout proportions, and the shape of the articular faces, as indicated
by the figures and by the measurements appended, that the species is
chiefly based. The articular surfaces of the basal caudal vertebrae are
remarkably triangular in shape, with the angles rounded, and the sides
of nearly equal length. This triangular shape is persistent for the
first twenty of the series as they are preserved. The paddles, as shown
in plates IV and V, show much stouter proportions than in either <i>C.
velox</i> or <i>C. tortor</i>.</p>

<p>The species comes nearest to <i>C. stenops</i> Cope, but it seems hardly the
same. It is, also, evidently allied to <i>C. dispar</i> Marsh. From these
and other described species, the following, extracted from the original
descriptions, will serve to show the differences, in comparison with
the specimen of <i>C. Westii</i>.</p>

<h4>C. dispar.</h4>

<p>The articular faces in the cervicals are a broad transverse oval,
faintly emarginated above for the neural canal. In the dorsals and
lumbars the cup continues transverse, and the emargination is deeper,
but in the anterior caudals the outline becomes a vertical oval. There
appears to have been thirteen mandibular teeth.</p>

Notes and Descriptions of Syrphidae.</h2></div>

<p>Among the insects obtained by Prof. F. H. Snow in a recent trip to
Colorado, is an excellent representative collection of the Diptera.
The material for the following notes on Syrphidae is chiefly drawn
from this collection. That such a collection affords so many points of
interest in this, one of the best studied families of North American
Diptera, is an evidence of the rich field that is presented by this
important and little-studied order of insects.</p>

<h3>CALLICERA.</h3>

<p><i>Callicera</i> Panzer, Fauna Germanica, 1806.</p>

<p><i>Callicera</i> is a small genus hitherto supposed to be peculiar to
Europe. The species are found in the high mountains, where the males
are often taken while hovering in the air. The present collection
includes numerous specimens of a species taken near the summit of Mt.
Deception, in Manitou Park, Colorado, at an altitude of nine thousand feet.</p>

<p>The occurrence of members of this genus in the western part of the
United States is a fact of especial interest and further substantiates
the rule that American forms common to Europe are more apt to occur
in the western regions. <i>Arctophila flagrans</i> Osten Sacken, is a case
precisely similar to the present one, belonging as it does to a small
European genus of mountain flies, and described from Colorado.</p>

<p>As the genus is a new one to our fauna, I here give an amended
transcription of the generic characters from Schiner’s Fauna Austriaca,
to include the new species, which differs only in unimportant details.</p>

<h4>Callicera.</h4>

<p>Rather large, stout, green or black species with metallic lustre and
abundant, long pile. Head hemispherical, somewhat broader than the
thorax. Antennae porrect, longer than the head, somewhat remote at
their base, inserted upon a protuberance of the front; first joint
sometimes elongate; second joint shorter than, or as long as, the first
joint; third joint one to three times the length of the first two
joints taken together, with a short, terminal style. Face broad, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the antennae concave in profile; an obtuse tubercle below the middle;
on the sides thickly covered with pile. Proboscis rather prominent,
with broad labella. Eyes hairy, holoptic in the male. Abdomen
elliptical, as long or longer than the thorax. Legs moderately strong.
Third longitudinal vein straight, first posterior cell distally short
petiolate; marginal cell open; cross-vein situated near the middle of
the discal cell, oblique.</p>

<h4>Callicera montensis, n. sp.,</h4>
<p class="big_indent">Plate vii, f. 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Male.</span> Black, densely golden red pilose. Frontal triangle,
face and cheeks deep black, shining, covered thickly with black pile, save
a median facial stripe. Antennae black, basal third of third joint on
the under side red; first joint short; second joint not more than half
as long as the first; third joint three times as long as the first and
second joints taken together; gradually broadened for a third of its
length, and then attenuated; style white. Eyes thickly clothed with
golden pile. Thorax and abdomen covered everywhere with long golden
red pile. Legs black; tarsal joints below and at their articulations
reddish. Wings nearly hyaline, brownish on the anterior basal portion;
stigma yellow.</p>

<p>Length 11 millimeters. Three specimens, Colorado.</p>

<p>The genus may be distinguished from <i>Pelecocera</i>, in Williston’s
dichotomic table of the genera of North American Syrphidae, by the pilose eyes.</p>

<h4>Microdon megalogaster, n. sp.,</h4>
<p class="big_indent">Plate vii, f. 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Male.</span> Large, yellowish pilose species, in shape globose.
Antennae reddish black, the first joint about as long as the following
two together; second joint not one-third as long as the third. Face
dark metallic green, shining, thickly covered with golden yellow
pile. Front black, with similar pile, narrowed in the middle. Eyes
bare. Thorax and scutellum deep metallic green, with long, thick,
golden pile; scutellum gently emarginate, the small obtuse tubercles
approximate. Abdomen short and broad, black, moderately shining; first
two segments and the hypopygium somewhat green; pile at base yellow,
elsewhere short, black. Legs black, with black pile; front tibiae
and their metatarsi, on the inner side, with short golden pile; hind
metatarsi incrassate and longer than the three following joints taken
together. Wings uniformly subinfuscate; veins at the outer part of the
first posterior and discal cells sinuous and rounded.</p>

<p>Length 12 millimeters. One specimen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h4>Chrysotoxum derivatum Walker.</h4>

<p>Eight specimens from Colorado, which vary not a little from each
other and from Williston’s description. They seem to belong here,
however, better than elsewhere. In one specimen, the second joint of
the antennae is shorter than the first, and only one-fourth the length
of the third. In five examples the second abdominal cross-band is
not interrupted; in the others it is distinctly parted. In two, the
third band does not reach the yellow of the broad hind margin; in two
others it barely touches it; in five, the two bands broadly coalesce.
The yellow of the fifth segment, in four specimens, incloses a black,
inverted V; in two others an inverted Y.</p>

<h4>Paragus bicolor Fabr.</h4>

<p>Three specimens, Colorado. These may be located under Schiner’s variety
<i>taeniatus</i>.</p>

<h4>Melanostoma stegnum Say.</h4>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3"><i>Syrphus stegnus</i> Say, Journ. Acad. Phil. vi, p. 163.</li>
<li class="isub3"><i>Melanostoma tigrina</i> Osten Sacken, Western Diptera, p. 323.</li>
<li class="isub3"><i>Melanostoma stegnum</i> Williston, Biol. Centr.-Amer. Diptera, iii, p. 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eleven specimens, Colorado, which answer well to the descriptions. The
metallic band of the fourth abdominal segment is sometimes interrupted,
and there is usually a triangular opaque black spot near the anterior
border of the fifth segment. “The female, hitherto unknown, has the
front broad above, pollinose, except on the upper part, and with black
pile; the thorax more shining metallic blue; the tibiae yellow, and
on the third and fourth abdominal segments there is a narrow shining
stripe, bisecting the black, as in the fourth segment of the male.
The male has some long black hairs on the outer side of the front and
middle tibiae, which are inconspicuous in the female. It is evident,
from the lighter color of the tibiae, that Say’s specimens were
females.” Williston, l. c.</p>

<h4>Melanostoma mellinum Linne.</h4>

<p>A single female specimen from Manitou Park.</p>

<h4>Melanostoma, n. sp. ?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Male.</span> Face and front dark metallic blue, shining,
thinly covered with light-colored pollen; tubercle and epistoma black,
shining, the former small. Antennae black, third joint yellowish red
below, oblong. Pile of frontal and vertical triangles dusky. Thorax
bronze-black, shining, sometimes bluish black, the pubescence white.
Halteres yellowish. Abdomen long and narrow, with almost parallel
sides; first segment metallic blue, shining; second segment opaque,
or subopaque, black, with a light metallescent scallop on the sides,
reaching to the distal third of the segment; third and fourth segments
similar, marked anteriorly by a wide, interrupted, or subinterrupted
blue fascia, deeply and widely emarginated, or concave behind; hind
border of the third, and sometimes of the second segment, narrowly
brown; fifth segment and the hypopygium metallic bluish green; sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the abdomen with silvery white pile, longest and thickest at the
base; the blue marking are whitish pruinose. Femora, except the tip,
a broad ring on the tibiae, and the four posterior tarsi, black;
elsewhere brownish or yellowish. Wings hyaline, stigma yellowish.</p>

<p>Length 7-8 millimeters.</p>

<h4>Eupeodes volucris, Osten Sacken.</h4>

<p>Numerous specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Syrphus arcuatus Fallen.</h4>

<p>Four specimens, Colorado. These specimens vary not a little from each
other, and somewhat from the descriptions. One female is very small,
not over seven millimeters in length, and with the spots on the third
and fourth abdominal segments hardly oblique. One male has the hind
femora black as far as the tip, while in three females the black does
not extend beyond the middle.</p>

<h4>Syrphus disjectus Williston.</h4>

<p>A single female specimen, from Colorado, agrees well with the
description drawn from males. The pile of the thorax is more whitish
than orange-yellow, and there are light colored lateral margins on the
anterior part of the thorax.</p>

<h4>Syrphus ruficauda, n. sp.,</h4>
<p class="big_indent">Plate vii, f. 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Male.</span> Eyes bare. Face greenish yellow on the sides,
yellow in the middle; a rather broad black line marks the border of the mouth
and is lost in the black of the cheeks. Frontal triangle yellow, with
long black pile. Antennae dark brown, more or less reddish below.
Pile of occiput light yellow. Dorsum of thorax deep metallic green,
the scutellum olivaceous yellow; both with light yellow pile. First
segment of the abdomen shining black; second segment opaque black,
with the lateral margins and hind border shining, and with a broad,
yellow, interrupted band, not reaching the lateral margins; third
segment similar, but with the yellow band somewhat wider, interrupted
or subinterrupted and slightly bilaterally oblique; fourth and fifth
segments orange-red, the sides narrowly black; the fourth segment shows
indistinctly a broad interrupted band of a somewhat lighter color,
corresponding to the yellow bands of the preceding segments. Legs light
brown; basal third of the front and middle femora and basal half of the
hind femora black. Wings hyaline, stigma yellowish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Female.</span> Head wanting. Thorax purplish brown. The
yellow band on the second abdominal segment narrower, the second band straight,
narrower and interrupted. Legs light brown, except the proximal end of
the femora, which is black.</p>

<p>Length 9 millimeters. Three males and one female, Colorado.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h4>Syrphus pauxillus Williston.</h4>

<p>Two specimens from Colorado undoubtedly come here. The species was
described from a single male specimen. A female specimen offers the
following differences or additions: Length nine millimeters, mesonotum
more greenish black or bronze, the pile obscure whitish; fifth
abdominal segment without yellow spots on the anterior angles; legs
yellow, with the basal half of the front and middle femora, the hind
femora except the tip, a broad band on the hind tibiae, and the hind
tarsi, black.</p>

<h4>Syrphus ribesii Linne.</h4>

<p>Five specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Syrphus americanus Wiedemann.</h4>

<p>Numerous specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Syrphus umbellatarum Schiner.</h4>

<p>Five female specimens, Colorado. The only western locality heretofore
given is Arizona (Williston).</p>

<h4>Allograpta obliqua Say.</h4>

<p>Five specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Mesogramma marginatum Say.</h4>

<p>Numerous specimens from Colorado, showing very great variation.</p>

<p><b>Sphaerophoria cylindrica</b> Say.</p>

<p>Twenty specimens, Colorado. I think the specimens belong here,
though a positive identification is hardly possible at present.</p>

<h4>Rhingia nasica Say.</h4>

<p>One specimen, Colorado. This is the first time that this species
has been recorded from beyond the Mississippi.</p>

<h4>Copestylum marginatum Say.</h4>

<p>Two specimens, Colorado, representing the extremes of variation in the
species. The male corresponds to <i>C. lentum</i> Williston. Specimens of
this species were bred from <i>Opuntia missouriensis</i>, in company with
others of <i>Volucella fasciata</i> Macq.</p>

<h4>Sericomyia militaris Walker.</h4>

<p>Sixteen specimens from Minnesota and Colorado vary in the markings of
the second abdominal segment, and in the color of the legs. Some have
no spots at all on the second segment; in others the two yellow dots
are conspicuous, approaching, in size and shape, the markings of the
third segment. The tibiae vary from light yellow to reddish brown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h4>Brachyopa cynops, n. sp.,</h4>
<p class="big_indent">Plate vii, f. 2.</p>

<p>Head light yellowish brown, largely concealed beneath light glistening
pollen; the shining ground color shows just above the antennae and in
a stripe on the cheeks, extending from the eye to the mouth opening.
Antennae wanting. Dorsum of thorax brown, covered with grayish pollen;
anteriorly with two approximated, linear, blackish stripes; laterally
with a broad, interrupted stripe. Scutellum light brown, with yellowish
pollen. Abdomen but little longer than broad; yellowish gray pollinose;
second segment with a circular brown spot in the anterior corners; the
two following segments are marked with corresponding elliptical spots,
and, in the middle of the anterior border with a triangular spot; on
the fifth segment are two small round spots. Legs uniformly reddish
brown, with light colored pollen and short whitish pile. Wing hyaline,
distinctly clouded at anterior cross-vein, on the veins at the anterior
outer corner of the discal cell and on the ultimate section of the
fourth vein; posterior cross-vein about as long as the penultimate
section of the fourth vein, the included angle obtuse.</p>

<p>Length 5 millimeters. One specimen, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Eristalis latifrons Loew.</h4>

<p>Numerous specimens, Colorado. The commonest Syrphid of the mountain
meadows. Some specimens have very indistinct brownish spots on the
second abdominal segment, and, when this is the case, the middle of the
wing generally shows a brown spot, and brown clouds along the anterior
veins between the spot and the base of the wing.</p>

<h4>Eristalis brousi Williston.</h4>

<p>One male specimen, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Helophilus latifrons Loew.</h4>

<p>Numerous specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Xylota flavitibia Bigot.</h4>

<p>Eight specimens, Colorado. The glistening pile of the face and front
varies from white to a golden yellow. On the dorsum of the thorax
purplish stripes are distinctly visible. The fourth segment of the male
abdomen is often red, as in the female abdomen.</p>

<h4>Syritta pipiens Linne.</h4>

<p>Eight specimens, Colorado.</p>

<h4>Criorrhina umbratilis Williston.</h4>

<p>A single, male specimen, collected by Mr. W. J. Coleman, at Lawrence,
and agreeing exactly with the description. The only other known
specimen of this species is the type, at Washington, from Connecticut.</p>

<h4>Spilomyia quadrifasciata Say.</h4>

<p>Seven specimens, Lawrence, Kansas, (F. H. Snow and E. S. Tucker). The
species has not hitherto been recorded west of New York.</p>

Notes on Melitera Dentata Grote.</h2></div>

<p>At the meeting of the Entomological Club of the A. A. A. S., held in
August, 1891, at Washington, Dr. Riley called attention to the habits
of <i>Melitera prodenialis</i> Walker. The larvae burrow into and feed upon
the fleshy leaves of the prickly pear, <i>Opuntia</i>. Dr. Riley’s specimens
came from Florida. Prof. J. B. Smith has recently bred the moth from
the prickly pear in New Jersey. His notes were presented at the same
meeting of the Club, and the brief references to the interesting
notes of Doctors Riley and Smith, made in the Canadian Entomologist
(v. xxiii, num. 11, pp. 242 and 256), suggest the presentation of the
following notes on <i>Melitera dentata</i> Grote, the western species of
this Phycitid genus.</p>

<p>Chancellor F. H. Snow, of this University, while investigating a
grasshopper “outbreak” (<i>Dissosteira longipennis</i>) in eastern Colorado
in July, 1891, noted the withered and dying condition of many leaves
of the common prickly pear cactus (<i>Opuntia missouriensis</i>), and
on examining the leaves found in them certain large, naked, bluish
larvae. The larvae were imbedded in the fleshy leaves, eating away the
soft inner tissue. The hollowed-out spaces were nearly filled with
irregularly spherical, yellowish, translucent casts. The attacked
leaves were withered and brown without. Prof. Snow took a few leaves and
larvae on July 16, near Arriba, Colorado, and brought them to the laboratory.</p>

<p>The larvae were put into breeding-cage on July 18. On July 28 one
larva had spun up and pupated in a corner of the cage behind a small
porcelain dish. Another had made a cocoon in a broken, empty pupa-case
of <i>Eacles imperialis</i>, but died before pupating. On August —— the
adults appeared, and have been determined by Prof. J. B. Smith as <i>M.
dentata</i>, Grote. As I am aware of no description of the earlier stages
of this species, I record the following notes of description:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egg.</span> About 1-1.2 millimeters in diameter,
surface with broad, meridian-like furrows from one pole for about
one-third of the distance to the other pole. Color, creamy white.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larva.</span> Food plant, <i>Opuntia missouriensis</i>,
prickly pear cactus, burrowing into the fleshy leaves and eating the soft,
succulent, inner tissues. Length, 40 millimeters. Five pairs of
prolegs. Color, one specimen, ultramarine blue; skin, semi-transparent
and shining anteriorly, dead blue on dorsum; second specimen, buffy
with a bluish suffusion, blue between segments, prolegs bluish, and
last abdominal segment blue, especially below; skin more opaque than
in first specimen. No pronounced markings of skin; spiracles shining
black and present on first thoracic and first to tenth abdominal
segments. Head flattened, slightly narrower than first thoracic
segment, umber. Prothoracic shield well marked, brownish black; anal
shield, smoky brownish. Clothing, limited to tubercled hairs sparsely
distributed as follows: a subdorsal line of small tubercles, two
tubercles to a segment, each tubercle bearing three short, fine hairs;
a supra-stigmatic line, one tubercle to each segment, each tubercle
bearing three to four fine hairs; a similar infra-stigmatic line; a
sub-ventral line of tubercles, bearing usually four fine hairs, the
tubercles of the three thoracic segments in this line situated at base
of legs outside, and similarly as to the prolegs on the third to sixth
abdominal segments. The tubercles in all the lines are faintly smoky.
The larva is rather heavy, and rotund in form, tapering toward both head
and posterior segment. It moves with a lumbering gait, but rather rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrysalis.</span> Length, 20 millimeters; in cocoon of silk,
loosely covered with small dirt-masses. As made in the breeding cage the
cocoons were above ground, but concealed under or in available objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adult.</span> The adults obtained from the breeding cage,
(there are no others in our collection), are easily distinguished from
<i>prodenialis</i> Wlk., by the much stronger dentations of the outer line
of the primaries. Prof. Smith kindly sent a specimen of <i>prodenialis</i>
taken at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, for comparison. The row of marginal
black spots on the primaries which Hulst (Tran. Am. Ent. Soc., v.
xvii, p. 172) mentions as distinctive of dentata is as pronounced in
Prof. Smith’s specimen of <i>prodenialis</i> as in our <i>dentata</i>. The much
lighter color of the primaries, head and thorax in dentata as mentioned
by Hulst is characteristic. An interesting feature in the venation of
the hind wings in our bred specimens of <i>dentata</i> is the considerable
coalescence of the sub-costal and costal veins. Vein five is wanting,
as mentioned by Hulst. In addition, there is further departure from
a normal venation, in that vein seven after rising with six from its
stem, (Hulst says: “Six short stemmed with seven”), coalesces for a
short distance with eight and then runs free to the margin. Behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
forking of seven and six the stem (remnant of sub-costal) unites with
the costal, and its basal portion is wholly merged with the forward
vein. This partial disappearance of the sub-costal seems to be shared
by <i>prodenialis</i> and is probably characteristic of the genus.</p>

<p>Prof. Smith, as recorded in the Canadian Naturalist, v. viii, p. 242,
(1891), bred several specimens of <i>Volucella fasciata</i>, a Syrphid fly,
from the same prickly pear leaves in which the <i>Melitera</i> larvae were
living. It is interesting to note that pupariae and later, adults of
<i>Volucella fasciata</i> and <i>Copestylum marginatum</i>, a closely allied
Syrphid, were noted in the Opuntia leaves from which <i>M. dentata</i> was
bred. (See note by Dr. Williston, Entomological News, v. ii, p. 165, 1891).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
